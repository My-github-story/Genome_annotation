## Week 4 + 5: Genome Annotation

### 1) Amino Acid Sequence Analysis
Given the amino acid sequence: **KVRMFTSELDIMLSVNG-PADQIKYFCRHWT***

#### a) Number of Amino Acids (not including the stop codon)
The provided amino acid sequence is:

**KVRMFTSELDIMLSVNG-PADQIKYFCRHWT***

The sequence ends with a stop codon, represented by the asterisk (*). To find the number of amino acids excluding the stop codon, we simply count the characters in the sequence and subtract one for the stop codon.

**Count of Amino Acids:**
- Total characters (including the stop codon) = **30** (KVRMFTSELDIMLSVNGPADQIKYFCRHWT*)
- Stop codon = **1**

**Number of Amino Acids:**
\[ 
\text{Total Amino Acids} = 30 - 1 = 29 
\]

#### b) Number of Bases in the Open Reading Frame (ORF) including the stop codon
Each amino acid is encoded by three nucleotide bases (codons). To find the total number of bases, we multiply the number of amino acids by **3**, and then add **3** for the stop codon since the stop codon also corresponds to a codon.

**Total Bases:**
- Total Amino Acids = **29**
- Codons for Amino Acids = \( 29 \times 3 = 87 \)
- Stop Codon = **3** bases

**Total Bases in ORF:**
\[ 
\text{Total Bases} = 87 + 3 = 90 
\]



## Summary of Answers

- **Number of Amino Acids (excluding stop codon):** 29
- **Number of Bases in the ORF (including stop codon):** 90
